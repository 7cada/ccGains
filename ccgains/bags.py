        ---

        The amount (minus fee) will not be taken out of bags, but marked
        as 'on-hold', which decreases the total amount of currency
        available for trades. Call `deposit` to decrease the amount
        'on hold'. A trade done while some money is still in transit
        (i.e. withdrawn, but not deposited yet), will still be paid for
        with money from the first bag (FIFO).

        Note: This is done this way because I am not sure if the tax
        agency would allow to park money by sending some to a wallet.
        This should be made user-configurable in future.

        ---

        Losses made by fees (which must be directly resulting from and
        connected to trading activity!) are substracted from the total
        taxable profit (recorded in base currency).

        This approach can be logically justified by looking at what
        happens to the amount of fiat money that leaves a bank account
        solely for trading with cryptocurrencies, which in turn are sold
        entirely for fiat money before the end of the year. If nothing
        else was bought with the cryptocurrencies in between, the
        difference between the amount of fiat before and after trading
        is exactly the taxable profit. For simplicity, say we buy some
        Bitcoin at one exchange for X fiat money (i.e. X fiat money is
        leaving the bank account), then transfer it to another exchange
        (paying withdrawal and/or deposit fees) where we sell it again
        for fiat, e.g.:
            - buy 1 BTC @ 1000 EUR at exchangeA;
              now we own 1 BTC with base value 1000 EUR
            - transfer 1 BTC to exchangeB for 0.1 BTC fees;
              now we own 0.9 BTC with base value 900 EUR,
              100 EUR for the fees are counted as loss
            - Example 1: We sell 0.9 BTC at a better price than before:
              we get exactly 1000 EUR. The immediate profit is 100 EUR
              (1000 EUR proceeds minus 900 EUR base value), but minus
              the 100 EUR fee loss from earlier we have exactly a
              taxable profit of 0 EUR, which makes sense considering
              we started with 1000 EUR and now still have only 1000 EUR.
            - Example 2: We sell 0.9 BTC at a much better price:
              we get exactly 2000 EUR. The immediate profit is 1100 EUR
              (2000 EUR proceeds minus 900 EUR base value), but minus
              the 100 EUR fee loss from earlier we have exactly a
              taxable profit of 1000 EUR, which also makes sense since
              we started with 1000 EUR and now have 2000 EUR.

        Note: The exact way how withdrawal, deposit and in general
        transaction fees are handled should be made user-configurable
        in future.
